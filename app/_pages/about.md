## About me
`#software_engineer` `#foodie` `#trying_to_loose_weight`

Originally from Jhansi, India, now lives in London, UK.
I have been working in the industry for ~10 years, and I am passionate about building products and even the boring stuff.
Professionally, my skills are in Python, Django, AWS, Celery, Kafka, RabbitMQ, ETL/ELT and fairly DevOps.

### I am an introvert but still here are my social links.
