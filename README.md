I recently recreated my blog website in Jekyll. This setup has working deployment to S3 using GitHub Action. 


## Tech I am using for this project:
1. GitHub action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/s3-sync
2. Theme: https://github.com/chesterhow/tale
3. Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com
4. Hosting on AWS using S3, Cloudwatch and Route53.
